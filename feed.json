            "content_html": "<h2>Who the manual is for – ambassador profiles</h2>\nThis Guidebook is aimed at cooperative ambassadors, i.e. young leaders who are interested in setting u p their own community-based cooperative business. These coop ambassadors will already have a range of resources, expertise and networks, as well as a range of skills acquired through their activities as youth leaders. <br><br>Coop ambassadors will typically be young people (up to 30 y.o.) who have demonstrated experience in successfully designing, setting up and implementing youth projects and/or managing youth organisations, or they may simply be motivated to start up their own cooperative business. Coop ambassadors will also have gone through a specific training about cooperatives and how to mobilize a community around a cooperative concept during CoopStarter 2.0, a EU project about cooperatives and youth entrepreneurship. <br>\n<h2>What the Guidebook is for and how it should be used</h2>\nThis Guidebook is designed to be a resource for coop ambassadors, after they have gone through a specific training on cooperatives and have studied and acquired concepts through learning materials, such as the Manual provided during the training. The Guidebook is meant to assist ambassadors in setting up and carry out local initiatives on cooperative entrepreneurship for young people. After having learnt how to set up a cooperative business, through physical training sessions provided by mentors, they will have to transfer this knowledge and experience in their local territories. This Guidebook was created with this purpose: all resources available on cooperative entrepreneurship and support, compiled in CoopStarter 2.0, are here integrated in order to be used in the most appropriate way and for the most efficient purpose, during local events/initiatives.<br><br>This Guidebook gives coop ambassadors a step-by-step methodology to carry out local initiatives meant to mobilize young people in setting up a cooperative business. It also helps them to organise their time/sessions in the most efficient way, making sure that clear objectives are set out and accomplished during those sessions. <br>\n<h2>What’s in the different sections of the Guidebook?</h2>\nThe manual has been developed in three sections:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/11\">THE BASICS</a> introducing cooperative principles: this part explains how to run a session on how to get young people to think about a business run in a cooperative form.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/12\">GENERATING IDEAS</a>: this part explains how to run a session on how to go from a business idea to the planning of a cooperative, which will be realising that idea and making it sustainable in time.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/13\">BRICK AFTER BRICK</a> making the cooperative a strong and stable house: this part explains how to run a session on business planning of a cooperative, making young potential entrepreneur understand how to start the path to building a coop business.</li>\n<li>ANNEXES: in this section, all resources used in the above three seminars/workshops are listed, including a main reference to this Guidebook, which is the booklet “Money Grows on Trees”.<br>Each section grows in complexity, starting from basic cooperative principles to compiling a business plan for a cooperative enterprise.<br>Each activity described in the manual is explained through the same scheme:</li>\n<li>OBJECTIVE (of the activity described)</li>\n<li>HOW TO USE IT + KEY QUESTIONS (related to the activity proposed)</li>\n<li>PROCESS (describe how to set up the activity, what you need to gather as resources, how and where to organize such an activity)</li>\n<li>DURATION (time span activity should take)</li>\n<li>EXPECTED RESULT (what young participants should take away from the specific activity)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Where can I find other useful resources?</h3>\nOther resources connected to this project that you will find useful are:\n<ul>\n<li>\"Young leaders, cooperative entrepreneurs\" report <br>This report outlines the context for youth entrepreneurship activities across the EU as well as showcasing case studies for inspiring ambassadors with their own cooperative start-ups.</li>\n<li>Manual for ambassadors<br>This learning material is aimed at young leaders who are interested in setting up their own community-based cooperative business.
