            "content_html": "<h2>Who the manual is for – ambassador profiles</h2>\nThis Guidebook is aimed at cooperative ambassadors, i.e. young leaders who are interested in setting up their own community-based cooperative business. These coop ambassadors will already have a range of resources, expertise and networks, as well as a range of skills acquired through their activities as youth leaders (see how much you as an Ambassador are networked enough in EU <a href=\"https://issuu.com/aegee-europe/docs/youropeneedsyou\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> - EN)<br><br>Coop ambassadors will typically be young people (up to 30 y.o.) who have demonstrated experience in successfully designing, setting up and implementing youth projects and/or managing youth organisations, or they may simply be motivated to start up their own cooperative business. Coop ambassadors will also have gone through a specific training about cooperatives and how to mobilize a community around a cooperative concept during CoopStarter 2.0, a EU project about cooperatives and youth entrepreneurship. Want to know more about what European Youth are looking for? Here's some <a href=\"https://issuu.com/aegee-europe/docs/europe_on_track\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interesting insights</a> from an EU-wide project (EN).<br>\n<h2>What the Guidebook is for and how it should be used</h2>\nThis Guidebook is designed to be a resource for coop ambassadors, after they have gone through a specific training on cooperatives and have studied and acquired concepts through learning materials, such as the Manual provided during the training or <a href=\"..\\media\\files\\YFJ_MoneyGrowsOnTreesweb.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this very useful booklet</a> about cooperatives (EN). The Guidebook is meant to assist ambassadors in setting up and carry out local initiatives on cooperative entrepreneurship for young people (<a href=\"..\\media\\files\\IO3-ENG_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">click here</a> to get inspired - EN or <a href=\"..\\media\\files\\philagora_la-trousse-a-idees.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> - FR). After having learnt how to set up a cooperative business, through physical training sessions provided by mentors, they will have to transfer this knowledge and experience in their local territories. This Guidebook was created with this purpose: all resources available on cooperative entrepreneurship and support, compiled in CoopStarter 2.0, are here integrated in order to be used in the most appropriate way and for the most efficient purpose, during local events/initiatives.<br><br>This Guidebook gives coop ambassadors a step-by-step methodology to carry out local initiatives meant to mobilize young people in setting up a cooperative business. It also helps them to organise their time/sessions in the most efficient way, making sure that clear objectives are set out and accomplished during those sessions. <a href=\"..\\media\\files\\pablo_-_outils_de_facilitation.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get inspired here</a>: how to get groups to work well together (FR).
